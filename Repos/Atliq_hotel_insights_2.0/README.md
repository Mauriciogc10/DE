# Atliq_hotel_insights_2.0
This is the updated version of previous Hospitality Domain project of ATLIQ based some useful feedback from stakeholder

# Problem Statement 
## Provide Insight to revenue team in Hospitality Domain
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. 
Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business 
hotels category.
As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. 
However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.
Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

### Task:  
1) Create the metrics according to the metric list.
2) Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
3) Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.

9) Insight from Property by Metrics Table-:
* While drill through the metrics table if we see occupancy % & check the bottom 5- Bangalore property 19558 has lowest occupancy followed by 2 each property of Mumbai & Hyderabad.
  In the same correspond to occupancy% bottom 5 property if we refer Average rating it is also at lowest which signifies that there must be isssuse in term of services in those property which equally effect customer booking.
* In Business Category Property-17564 of Mumbai has highest ADR-16597 along with that it has lowest booking and even Average rating is as low.
* Similary for same category Property in Hyderabad and Delhi has lowest ADR value ranges from 9185 to 12480.
* For Luxury category Property in Mumbai has high ADR if we through it using both the card top 5 property with high ADR in this category are from Mumbai itself and similary in low ADR case Hyderabad has highest no. of Property with low ADR value.
* Mumbai Property-16559 has highest no. of Booking with maximum revenue.

## Some Possible Measures
1) While Analysis of report one think is very much clear that all property has Flat Price through season as per 3 month data which generally not good for generating high revenue hospitality industries. 
   We should kept Dynamic Pricing or Weekend Hike for Current booking.
2) Their is also not much difference in term of ADR mention at booking channel, atleast  we can put  little higher price with providing some offer like discount in next booking, breakfast free, or other available service offer.
   Keeping Higher price on our booking channel can generated good revenue since there will be no commission charge in compare of listing in other site.
3) We also observed that Average rating for most of property is very low (<3.0) and even in some booking customer didn't mention any rating after checkout. 
   The main possible reason could be service provide to customer which would be not satisfactory, hence bad service also affect the occupancy and revenue correspond to it.
4) What we can do first check the services issues improve as soon as possible, provide some  offer to attract more customer ,
   asked for there valuable review while stay and checkout.
